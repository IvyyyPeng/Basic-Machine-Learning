## Machine Learning Based on KNN in Python

## Author: Ivy Peng 


## Introduction 

This program recognizes handwritten letters based on KNN model. Coding in Python 
s
source.py: all the codes

disign_doc.docx. explain the overall design idea and the algorithm, including (a) how the closest neighbors are chosen and (b) the rule(s) used in making the prediction 
â€¨digit-training.txt: training data set

digit-validating.txt: validation data set, used to test different models and choose one with highest accuracy

digit-predict.txt: use the chosen model to recognize the numbers

output.txt: the output of running the program 


## Usage

After download the file, open the terminal, run the following command 

| > python2 source.py

Then the output will be shown on the consol.
