## Introduction 

This program recognizes handwritten digits from 0 to 9 based on KNN model.
The shape of digits is presented by matrices of 0's and 1's.
Coding in Python 3.

source.py: all the main codes.

vector.py: helper functions used to calculate the distance between data points.

design_doc.docx. explain the overall design idea and the algorithm,
including (a) how the closest neighbors are chosen and (b) the rule(s) 
used in making the prediction. 

digit-training.txt: training data set with sample size 943.

digit-validating.txt: validation data set with size 196, used to test different models and 
choose one with highest accuracy - 96%.

digit-predicting.txt: prediction data set with size 8. Use the chosen model to recognize the numbers.

output.txt: the output of running the program. 


## Usage

After the file is downloaded, open the terminal, run the following command 

| > python3 source.py

Note: the source file must be run with Python 3.

Then the output will be shown in the console.
